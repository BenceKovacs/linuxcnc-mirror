The "motion" tests aim to test the motion module's behavior.

start a full emc in sim mode, with linuxcncrsh as the UI.

They run g-code programs and use halsampler to monitor the motions that
motmod emits to HAL.


Todo:

    use the configs/sim/check_constraints.hal file instead of checkresults?

        include wcomp outputs in halsampler so we can see what went wrong

    add blending tests

    test pause/resume in the middle of a move

    test maxvel changing in a move
